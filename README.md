# kickbot
bot-kicking for tg @dormentor
sorry for the govnocode, no time to work with it, but it works fine.

change the reasons account become "suspicious" in function /check_suspicious. for example there is the same profile photo date between some hours in july(more 500 bots were kicked)
howto:
/admin @channelname -> /check @channelname ->[optional]-> /get_suspicious @channelname -> /kick_suspicious @channelname -> loop till 0 bots in
